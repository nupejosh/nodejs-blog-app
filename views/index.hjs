                        <p>
                            Hey guys! Welcome to my Node.js inspired blog app. This was built entirely on top of node with a little, well alot of help from Express.js and Mongoose. This was a fun little app for me to throw together; I'll tell you a bit about my adventure and kinks along the way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Installing all of my app's dependencies was the easy part thanks to npm. Once my app's environment was up and ready for me to reek havoc I dove in to the app.js file to get started with some routing. I'm some what of a reward fein and so I couldn't help but to make a quick custom route and send a message to the screen. I blame the endless "Hello World" starter apps. After my hunger was satisfied, I made sure to abstract my routing for my index page out to it's own file in the routes folder. That way things would be a lot more legible :) . Once the routing was abstracted I made a goofy little HTML file that could take some input. I wanted to take a swing at storing data into mongo. <br/>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For communicating with mongo I used the mongoose node package. It was pretty intuitive once I read over the docs a bit. Although that may be because I use mongodb on a daily and they're pretty similar. Either way once I defined my Schema and it was smooth sailing except for one slight caveat. If you're like me and decide to abstract some behavior out into it's own folders/files you'll have to remember to require the necessary files for everything to work together properly. I had to debug for a solid 30 minutes before I realized that I didn't require my my mongoose models files in my routes! A prime example of programming's beauty lol. 
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            I'll keep my adventure tales short and explain a bit more about whats going on here in the app. The page you're seeing is actually a 'hjs' or better known as an Express Hogan file. I used this templating framework because I prefer HTML to Jade and Hogan's use of handle bars is pretty intuitive.<br>
                            Aside from the content of this blog post the nodejs magic happens in the comments section. Essentially I've connected the form to a route that save the input to my mongodb and from there node renders the newly submitted comment to the page using Hogan's handle bars. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Next up, I'll include all comments at the bottom of the page and append the newly submitted comments to the top of the list. But that's for the next post. Enjoy ;) !
                        </p>
